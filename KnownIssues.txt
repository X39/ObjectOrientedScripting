- Creating a new variable containing an object requires auto keyword.
  Thus, the following is not possible:
  
  `::std::vehicle variable = new ::std::vehicle("foobar");`

- (Not rly an issue but more of a note) currently only idents are allowed to be
  callen. Thus you cannot call from an expression
  following would be invalid:
  `(new foobar()).foo()`
  due to the fact that it is the following:
  <EXPRESSION>.<IDENT><FUNCTIONCALL>
