- Passing an object of the same class which you are in right now will result in
  the object getting assigned an invalid type
  ((Internally it will ref to the function which is for sure nonsense ...
    however ... harder to fix then it might sounds in first place due to the
	lower logic behind it))

- (Not rly an issue but more of a note) currently only idents are allowed to be
  callen. Thus you cannot call from an expression
  following would be invalid:
  `(new foobar()).foo()`
  due to the fact that it is the following:
  `<EXPRESSION>.<IDENT><FUNCTIONCALL>`

- Casts currently do not check if given object is kind of cast target thus you
  can enforce invalid object types

- Downcasting has to be done explicit
