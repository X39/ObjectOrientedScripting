Version 0.7.1-ALPHA
	|- Compiler:  fixed third for argument is printed at the very begining
	
Version 0.7.0-ALPHA
    |- Compiler:  fixed objects added using the using instruction where not
    |             touched by the PreProcessor
    |- Compiler:  printout syntax got altered slightly (missing tabs and invalid
    |             new lines)
    |- Compiler:  fixed for required all params or it would throw a NPE
    |- Compiler:  fixed NPE when assigning variables in other namespaces
    |- Compiler:  fixed StackOverflow case with this variable
    |- Compiler:  using directive threw out folder path instead of file path
    |- Compiler:  using now is generalized (no difference between local and std
    |             includes) thus syntax changed:
    |             using ::foo::bar
    |             instead of
    |             using "::foo::bar" or using <::foo::bar>
    |- Compiler:  fixed invalid encapsulation on object function "toString"
    |- Compiler:  Changed cast operator from %...% to <...>
    |- Compiler:  fixed templates only could use native types
    |- Compiler:  added internal class "array"
    |- Compiler:  added internal class "string"
    |- Compiler:  Parser is more solid now (side effect thx to EBNF changes)
    |- Compiler:  Fixed CfgFunctions class is never written out regardless of
    |             the NFNC flag
    |- Compiler:  Fixed invalid distinction between variable and function when
    |             using a class variable with an object as type
    |- Compiler:  class & native syntax now supports flags
    |             (not important for generic oos users)
    |             `class <IDENT> flags <FLAG1> <FLAG2> <FLAGN>`
    |             Flags which got introduced:
    |             - disableConstructor
    |             - noObjectExtends
    |             - virtualFunctionsOnly (not available in native)
    |- Compiler:  Introduced enum`s. They got following syntax:
    |             enum { <IDENT1> [ = <VALUE2> ], <IDENTN> [ = <VALUEN> ] }
    |- Compiler:  SQF instruction now supports forcedType via "as". Example:
    |             `SQF allPlayers as ::std::Array<::std::Men>`
    |- stdLib:    added ::std::UI::Display object
    |- stdLib:    added ::std::UI::Control object
    |- stdLib:    added ::std::Marker object
    |- stdLib:    fixed invalid typing in ::std::base::VehicleBase object
    |- stdLib:    removed ::std::Array object (moved to internal classes)
    |- stdLib:    removed ::std::String object (moved to internal classes)
    |- stdLib:    added get-/setObject function to ::std::Context
    \- .oosproj:  Added <srcfolder> attribute to set the source folder
    
Version 0.6.2-ALPHA
    |- Compiler:  fixed various minor issues
    |- Compiler:  removed multi-base classes
    |- Compiler:  improved object structure (==> less overhead)
    |- Compiler:  fixed overloaded functions overwriting themself
    |- Compiler:  fixed different case same name functions overwriting themself
    |- Compiler:  temporary disabled interfaces as function argument
    |- Compiler:  fixedasync keyword made functions being callen instead of 
    |             spawned (and vice versa)
    |- Compiler:  unlocked the native "object" object (actually thats a speciall
    \             internal class now, might happen with string too soon)
    
Version 0.6.1-ALPHA
    |- Compiler:  fixed InstanceOf printout
    |- Compiler:  Introduced "using" operation, replaces #include
    |- Compiler:  #include now wont "include" the file anymore and instead just
    |             checks the PreProcessor directives in given file
    |- Compiler:  Added "extends" keyword to native classes --> you now can
    |             extend native classes now
    |- Compiler:  Added code for the "async" keyword on functions (sorry)
    |- Compiler:  "PRINTMODE" flag modes have changed:
    |             Possible modes are: NONE, 0, NEEDED, 1, ALL, 2
    |- stdLib:    Renamed all stdLibrary objects to have first char uppercase
    |- stdLib:    Added "VehicleBase" object to stdLibrary (not intended to be
    |             created via new, will throw an error when you attempt)
    |- stdLib:    Added "Man" object to stdLibrary, represents all CAManBase
    |             ArmA objects
    \- WrapperUI: Introduced WrapperUI.exe, a UI for OOS <3 (to be improved)
    
Version 0.6.0-ALPHA                                                             
    |- Compiler:  Rewrote entire Linker & Writer                                
    |- Compiler:  Added !syntax! to call base constructors via following:       
    |             bar(arg1, arg2, argn) : foo(arg1, "foobar", argn) {...}       
    |- Compiler:  During Linking, functions will now check if they always return
    |             (only exception for this are VOID functions)                  
    |- Compiler:  Added "PRINTMODE=<MODE>" Flag                                 
    |             Possible modes are: NONE, 0, NEEDED, 1, PARTIAL, 2, ALL, 3    
    |- Compiler:  Added fast assign operators: ++, --, +=, -=, *=, /=

    |- Compiler:  Function Overloading is now possible                          
    |- Compiler:  Added "async" keyword for functions (see INFO1)               
    |             async functions have to have the return type void!            
    |- INFO1:     Functions syntax got altered:                                 
    \             <encapsulation> [async] [override] <type> <name> ( <argList> )
