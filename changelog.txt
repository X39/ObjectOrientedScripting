Version 0.3.1-ALPHA
    |- Compiler: Fixed warning messages popping up during write out when
    |            a class has no constructor
    |- Compiler: Imrpooved SQF syntax output (removed "private[...]" instruction
	|            from functions as "params" marks them private to scope already)

Version 0.3.0-ALPHA
    |- Compiler: changed block native code from:
    |                native <instructions> endnative
    |            to:
    |                startnative <instructions> endnative
    |- Compiler: Added "native(<instructions>)" specially for expressions
    |            (will be merged at some point with the block native again)
    |- Compiler: Added SQF Call instruction:
    |                SQF [ (<arg1>, <argN>) ] <instruction> [ (<arg1>, <argN>) ]
    |- Compiler: Added missing detection for
    |            unsigned integer/double values in VALUE
    |- Compiler: Added missing detection for
    |            >, >=, <, <= operations in EXPRESSION
    |- Compiler: Added missing LOCALVARIABLE alternative for FORLOOP
    |- Compiler: Fixed FORLOOP
    |- Compiler: PrettyPrint sqf output improved
